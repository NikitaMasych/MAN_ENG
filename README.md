WelcomeðŸ‘‹! Here are collected python 3.8 programs generating different fractals. 

Simple ones use elementary turtle graphics, whereas complex calculus-based use pygame module. 
Each folder contains .py code and .exe assembled application ready to be run.

This programs was developed and used in Small Science Academy work on the applied math category.
Totally project got 3rd place on All-Ukrainian stage.

All turtle-oriented programs download one .eps image of the generated fractals in the process of the running.
All programs use concole in order to obtain few parameters neccessary for generation.

During developing of the Mandelbrot set appeared an idea to use different from 2 power in the main formula.
Result of this you able to see in the Power iterative set program - symmetric properties of the complex numbers.

Honestly, I made them just for funðŸ¤—
